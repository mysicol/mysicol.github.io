                Incredible live recording and I'm definitely not a live recordings person.
                This includes some of my favorite ambient Pink Floyd songs (Echoes, A Saucerful of Secrets, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun) and they flow really nicely.

                So basically it's about a linguist who is attempting to decipher an alien language.

                But it's actually focusing on themes of determinism and free will, and the compatibility of those concepts.


            </p>

                <i>
                    "The heptapods are neither free nor bound as we understand those concepts;
                    they don't act according to their will, nor are they helpless automatons.
                    What distinguishes the heptapods' mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history's events;
                    it is also that their motives coincide with history's purposes.
                    They act to create the future, to enact chronology.
                    Freedom isn't an illusion; it's perfectly real in the context of sequential consciousness."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                While we are talking about theoretical and obviously non-existent aliens,
                I think the important point to note here is that free will is a thing which you can decide to have even within a deterministic construct.

            <h2>philosophy</h2>
            <p>These reflect my current views which change extremely often.
                I think these are probably more accurately just the ideas I like right now.
                Philosophy is just determining a way to best interpret and cope with existence,
                so there is not really a right answer to any of these questions.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Overview
            </h3>
            <p>
                Something that really annoys me in philosophy is when people argue about definitions.
                Words do not inherently have meanings. And so questions like "Does free will exist?" are
                meaningless. A major theme in my ideas is that we must define concepts in order for them to begin
                to have meaning. This automatically answers a lot of stupid questions like whether we have free will.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time I am solidly a nihilist. Which actually does follow from what I just said.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Free will
            </h3>
            <p>
                I'm writing about free will first because I think I just pretty much summed it up already.
                I am a hard determinist in the mathematical sense. But I don't think that negates
                the existence of free will.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the clearest way I can say it: I am a cluster of moving particles which I have defined to be
                a human being. If I choose to further define myself as a being with free will, then I possess
                free will.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think one of the major issues people have with determinists is the qualification of the criminal justice system
                and similar institutions which reward certain individuals and punish others according to their merit in a framework where 
                people lacked the ability to actually control their actions on a fundamental level. And I have a couple of responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I really don't think I've expressed anything here that isn't just a fundamental mathematical fact of the universe.
                Consider a universe in which free will does exist. What exactly does that mean? I'm not talking about random quantum activity,
                which is something I really feel like I don't have a level of education to discuss. You can't tell me random quantum events
                are you somehow exerting agency. Determinism is just the mathematical truth, at least on a large scale.
                Think about it and if your political views don't run consistent with a lack of free will then maybe you should reconsider them.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it's fair to express concern that we cannot hold people accountable for their actions if it turns out they weren't responsible
                for their actions in the first place, though. And that is why we must define free will as existing. The correct response is to accept
                that maybe there is nothing that happens that is not inevitable while still balancing the ethical principles of behaving in a way which
                will minimize human suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again I really feel that your moral and political views should hold consistent with these ideas. I am doing the ethical thing by accepting that
                you have no cosmic choice in the matter but still asking you to reconsider your perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <h3>Definition of self</h3>
            <p>
                This is one of the points that is completely a preference thing.
            <p>
                I currently define the percieved universe as an extension of the self. 
                This is not a self-centered perspective. It is more like an entanglement between the self and the universe
                than the universe centered about the self.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite result of this definition of self is that it resolves a major
                issue left unaddressed by "I think therefore I am." This quote is comforting when grappling with whether the self
                exists, but it provides no evidence that the existence of anything else follows.
                The inclusion of the entire universe as a feature of my own consciousness
                inherently provides sufficient evidence. I think things besides myself exist, therefore they do.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also allows you to view other people differently (if you manage to convince yourself they actually exist).
                Every person contains their own universe, and getting to know someone closely becomes so much more beautiful
                because you gain the opportunity to interact with this world that is completely foreign to yours. 
                Art especially is an ideal format for this correspondence.
            </p>

            <p>First EP.</p>
            <p>The title is a play on "dismembered eyes". 
                It was written about seeing things not as they really are, embedded with a false sense of urgency as the close of another year rapidly approaches.

            <p>Overall: 4/10.</p>
            <p>I honestly do not like this EP at all. 
            I don't think any of the songs are particularly interesting except "Waning Light",
            but I was so excited to release that song that I only spent about a day recording and producing it.
            It sounds like there was a good idea but very poorly executed.
            The rest of the songs are just super boring. 
            I improvised "Floes" on my laptop keyboard in about 10 minutes and spent like an hour producing it but it's probably the best song on there.
            The end of "Unraveled" is also pretty good. But the rest is unlistenably boring.</p>
