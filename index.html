            <h3>definition of the self.</h3>
            <p>
                My current philosophy is that the entire universe is an extension of the self. 
                This is not a self-centered perspective.
                It answers a question proposed in "I think therefore I am".
                This point provides no evidence that the rest of the universe exists beyond your own imagination.
                Therefore we can define the entire universe as being completely contained by my own understanding.
                This definition provides sufficient evidence for the existence of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This results in significant questions and pain on loss.

            <p>The title is a play on "dismembered eyes". 
                It was written about seeing things not as they really are, embedded with a (false?) sense of urgency as the close of another year rapidly approaches.
                I honestly do not like this EP very much. 
                Someday I may re-record Waning Light because it was a cool idea but I executed it terribly.</p>
