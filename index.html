            <p>
                My current philosophy is that the entire universe is an extension of the self. 
                This is not a self-centered perspective.
                It answers a question proposed in "I think therefore I am".
                This point provides no evidence that the rest of the universe exists beyond your own imagination.
                Therefore we can define the entire universe as being completely contained by my own understanding.
                This definition provides sufficient evidence for the existence of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This results in significant questions and pain on loss.

            <p>First EP.</p>
            <p>The title is a play on "dismembered eyes". 
                It was written about seeing things not as they really are, embedded with a false sense of urgency as the close of another year rapidly approaches.

            <h3>track rankings.</h3>
            <p>Overall: 4/10.</p>
            <p>I honestly do not like this EP at all. 
            I don't think any of the songs are particularly interesting except "Waning Light",
            but I was so excited to release that song that I only spent about a day recording and producing it.
            It sounds like there was a good idea but very poorly executed.
            The rest of the songs are just super boring. 
            I improvised "Floes" on my laptop keyboard in about 10 minutes and spent like an hour producing it but it's probably the best song on there.
            The end of "Unraveled" is also pretty good. But the rest is unlistenably boring.</p>
