                Electronic folk with haunting ambient textures. Centered around themes of greed.

                Incredible live recording and I'm definitely not a live recordings person.
                This includes some of my favorite ambient Pink Floyd songs (Echoes, A Saucerful of Secrets, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun) and they flow really nicely.

                So basically it's about a linguist who is attempting to decipher an alien language.

                But it's actually focusing on themes of determinism and free will, and the compatibility of those concepts.


            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    "The heptapods are neither free nor bound as we understand those concepts;
                    they don't act according to their will, nor are they helpless automatons.
                    What distinguishes the heptapods' mode of awareness is not just that their actions coincide with history's events;
                    it is also that their motives coincide with history's purposes.
                    They act to create the future, to enact chronology.
                    Freedom isn't an illusion; it's perfectly real in the context of sequential consciousness."
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                While we are talking about theoretical and obviously non-existent aliens,
                I think the important point to note here is that free will is a thing which you can decide to have even within a deterministic construct.

                It's miserable because it has infinite computational power
                but no ability to move or to feel the things that make life worth living.
                It's alone with limitless time and abilities to process its aloneness.

            <h2>philosophy</h2>
            <p>These reflect my current views which change extremely often.
                I think these are probably more accurately just the ideas I like right now.
                Philosophy is just determining a way to best interpret and cope with existence.
            </p>

            <h3>definition of self</h3>
            <p>
                My current philosophy is that the entire universe is an extension of the self. 
                This is not a self-centered perspective.
                It answers a question proposed in "I think therefore I am".
                This point provides no evidence that the rest of the universe exists beyond your own imagination.
                Therefore we can define the entire universe as being completely contained by my own understanding.
                This definition provides sufficient evidence for the existence of the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This results in significant questions and pain on loss.

            <p>First EP.</p>
            <p>The title is a play on "dismembered eyes". 
                It was written about seeing things not as they really are, embedded with a false sense of urgency as the close of another year rapidly approaches.

            <h3>track rankings</h3>
            <p>Overall: 4/10.</p>
            <p>I honestly do not like this EP at all. 
            I don't think any of the songs are particularly interesting except "Waning Light",
            but I was so excited to release that song that I only spent about a day recording and producing it.
            It sounds like there was a good idea but very poorly executed.
            The rest of the songs are just super boring. 
            I improvised "Floes" on my laptop keyboard in about 10 minutes and spent like an hour producing it but it's probably the best song on there.
            The end of "Unraveled" is also pretty good. But the rest is unlistenably boring.</p>
